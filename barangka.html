				<h1>History</h2>
				
				<p>Barangka is named after the Spanish canyon, barranca. It is located along the western border of Marikina, is bordered on the west by Loyola Heights in Quezon City; to the south City; to the south by barangays Industrial Valley and Calumpang; to the east by Tanong; and the north by Loyola Grand Villas. On its south portion lies the Marikina River where the Riverbanks Center is located. Barangka actually lies on the hills of Quezon City, not too far from the Marikina fault system. </p>
				<p>Along with former Parang and Nangka, the former sitio was elevated to barangay by virtue of Republic Act No. 2601, which was enacted on June 21, 1959.</p>
				<p>Barangka is surrounded by schools, shopping malls, industrial zones, and transport hubs. It is accessible to neighboring commercial and business areas.</p>
