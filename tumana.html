Officially its bounderies are delineated as follows: From the corner of Everlasting street and Roxas street, Twinville Subdivision going south, along the center-line of rosas street, J. Del Rosario street and Angel Santos Street; thence along the center-line of Old Marikina River Course until it intersects the property of Wood Ridge Residential Estate and Loyola Grand Villas; thence to the north-west along Finland Street until it intersects Quezon City boundary; thence to the northeast along Marikina-Quezon City boundary until it crosses Marikina River; and thence to the east along the Everlasting Street until it intersects the point of beginning.</p>
				<p>The place has been geologically shaped by soil build-up resulting from flooding, erosion, and landslide.</p>
				<p>Part of the barangay was a component of the riverbank but ita has been coverted into a fertile land. over the centuries, the accretion has been cultivated as rice fields and fruit farms.</p>
