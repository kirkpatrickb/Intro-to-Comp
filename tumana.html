				<h1>History</h1>
				
				<p>The Frenchman Vincent Fabron lives his life in search of one necessary goal, willing to sacrifice anything that gets in his way of achieving it. He has spent much of his time involved with combat and weapons, having worked for the French military before becoming a PMC marksman and then a weapons designer for Kingdom Defense. His employment at Kingdom was only a stepping stone for him though, as by this point he was already set on his path in pursuit of his sacred truth.</p>
				
				<p>One such event that exemplified Fabron's will to continue with his goals no matter the cost surrounds his actions at the Everett-Linde Research Facility in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he traveled to around 9 AFL and began communicating with employees there. Fabron soon found himself barred from entering facility grounds shortly after attempting to access their systems but eventually returned to reinstate his security clearance and obtain schematics. However, he was soon forced to make a decision that required him to destroy the facility's Large Radian Collider. Having already made contact with his Omega counterpart, together they fired on the LRC on the day the lab's people were celebrating its supposed success. The resulting explosion killed many of its employees and the facility was reduced to a husk.</p>
				
				<p>Not long after the events of Everett-Linde, Fabron encountered senior VALORANT Protocol agents Brimstone and Viper, where together they were put in an unpleasant situation. After promoting himself as someone who could help VALORANT out with their Omega Project, the Protocol's leadership gave Fabron a position as their eighteenth agent. Becoming "Chamber", he immediately proved himself to be a necessary asset to the VP's goals, providing blueprints necessary to properly construct an Alpha-Omega teleporter, as well as helping with its power issues by recommending a prospective agent with radiant abilities that could help.</p>
				
				<p>Even with his new partnership with the VALORANT Protocol though, Chamber's necessary goal still remains to be achieved. With some of his fellow agents (including some of Earth's most skilled investigators and devoted defenders) already having their suspicions about his motives, Chamber has to tread more carefully than ever before if he is to reach his final objective - and be prepared for judgement when the truth of his character is revealed as a result.</p>
