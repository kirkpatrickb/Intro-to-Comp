				<p>
				Marikina was founded <b>383 years ago</b> when the Jesuits arrived in 1630. They called the area Jesus dela Peña (Jesus of the Rocks). It was later called <b>Mariquina</b> and a parish was established there in 1687. <b>Fishing and farming</b> were the main source of livelihood. In 1901, the town was officially named Marikina by the First Philippine Commissioner, <b>Trinidad Pardo de Tavera</b> replacing the Hispanidad “q” with the vernacular “k”. Later in 1977, the town was officially made a part of the newly-created Metro Manila area.
				</p> 

				<p>
				The significant year for Marikina was in 1887. It was in this year when <b>shoemaking started to flourish through the efforts of Don Laureano "Kapitan Moy" Guevarra.</b> From this year, the growth of the place economically becomes dynamic due to <b>shoemaking.</b> Today, Marikina is one of the sixteen (16) cities and a municipality of Metro Manila. It was proclaimed a city through the Republic Act 8223 on December 8, 1996. It is a multi-awarded metropolitan city, often cited for its <b>vibrant economy, highly-skilled and literate work force, involved and enlightened business community and responsive local government </b> that puts a <b> premium on governance, sustainable urban development and public service. </b> It is also one of the healthiest cities in the Asia-Pacific region, winning at least seventy-eight awards and recognitions both local and international in a span of twelve years.

				Today, Marikina is known as the <b><i>Shoe Capital of the Philippines</i></b> because of its progressive shoe industry. It is also the home of the world’s largest pair of shoes certified by the <b>Guinness Book of World Records.</b> Furthermore, the Shoe Museum preserved most of the famous shoes of former First Lady Imelda Marcos. The city also prides itself of cultural and heritage site, Kapitan Moy, the ancestral house of the Father of the Shoe Industry in the Philippines, Don Laureano Guevara and other numerous tourist sites.
