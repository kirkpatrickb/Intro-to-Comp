				</div>
				
				<p>
				<b>Valorant</b> is a <b>team-based first-person hero shooter</b> set in the near future. Players play as one of a set of <b>Agents</b>. Agents have unique <b>abilities</b>, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. 
				</p> 

				<p>
				In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the <b>attacking</b> or <b>defending</b> team with each team having five players on it. In the standard non-ranked mode, the match is played as best of 25 - the first team to win 13 rounds wins the match. The attacking team has a bomb-type device called the <b>Spike</b>. They must deliver and activate the Spike on <b>one of the multiple specified locations</b> (bomb sites). If the <b>attacking</b> team successfully protects the activated Spike for 45 seconds it <b>detonates</b>, destroying everything in a specific area, and they receive a point. If the <b>defending</b> team can <b>deactivate</b> the spike, or the 100-second round timer expires without the attacking team activating the spike, the defending team receives a point. If all the members of a team are eliminated before the spike is activated, or if all members of the defending team are eliminated after the spike is activated, the opposing team earns a point.

				<p>
				Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges. Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives completed. The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles.
