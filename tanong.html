				<h1>History</h2>
				
				<p>Barangay Ta単ong traces its origin to March 1898 when pioneering families decided to formally establish community. Like many rural communities in colonial Philippines, it had its formal beginnings during the period when missionary work was pervasive in areas with existing settlements and in places near river sources.</p>
				<p>During the Spanish rule, Ta単ong was populated by migrants from nearby Balara and Krus na Ligas (Gulod) areas. The area was not just a favorite hunting ground for individuals who were considered fugitives by the colonial regime; it was also an impoverished community that was subjected to many abuses of the civil guards.</p>
				<p>Life, however, was better under the American rule. New developments were introduced and living conditions improved. The eruption of war derailed all these inroads. But with Liberation, life in the barrio started to show promise with the influx of new arrivals, some of whom have permanently settled in an area aptly called, Halo-halo (hodgepodge).</p>
