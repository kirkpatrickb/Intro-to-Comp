				<h1>History</h2>
				
				<p>The barangay was named after a wild almond (sterculia foetida). The largest among the barangays of Marikina during the colonial period, Calumpang was originally bordered on the north-west by the Marikina River and immediately opposite it are barangays Ta単ong and Jesus de la Pe単a. </p> 

				<p>Floods and soil erosion would drastically alter its landscape, giving to shrinkage and expanding the two other barangays from silt build-up. Over time, part of the river dried up, giving way to what is known as Patay na Ilog, an area where Provident Village is now situated. To spare it from nature's threats, a dike was constructed in the early 1950s to secure the barangay.</p>
				
				<p>In the pre-war era, Calumpang's land extended as far west above the hills of Quezon City, which is a section of White Plains; on the north north-west, the Marikina River; on the east, Pasig City; and as far north as the boundaries of barangays Jesus dela Pe単a, Ta単ong, and Barangka. With the creation of Quezon City in 1939, its jurisdiction was altered. Although it remained a part of Marikina, its boundary on the west sector was reduced.</p>
				
				<p>The area from the chapel of San Antonio de Padua to the residence of Teodulo Marcelo and the Tayug family were added to the city. It was only after the war, through the effort of Rep. Emilio dela Paz, Sr., that it regained a portion of the disputed area that extended up to Usiw Hills, near Quezon City, which is now part of Industrial Valley. Later, when Industrial Valley was created into an independent barangay, its area of influence was again reduced.</p>
