				<h1>History</h2>
				
				<p>Sta. Elena got its name from a cross-shaped driftwood that was found floating in the river.</p>
				<p>The barangay traces it beginnings to 1687 when the Jesuits stationed at the Jesus de la Pe√±a mission were looking for a new church site. The settlement was then a rural community of contented folk who survived from the fruits of their farms and depended on fish from the nearby Marikina River. Over time, the rural community flourished, becoming the poblacion of what now is Marikina City. Although it had progressed very well, it also had its share of tragedies. In 1825 and 1880, strong tremors rocked the place.</p>
				<p>Another c "astrophe occurred in 1887 when a fire burned down the flourishing neighborhood. A similar calamity took place in 1974 in which numerous laborers were lethally trapped inside the workplace.</p>
				<p>In World War II, like most of the barangays of the city, Sta. Elena also had its share of devastation from bombing runs.</p>
