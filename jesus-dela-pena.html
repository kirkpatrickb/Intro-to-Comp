				<h1>History</h2>
				
				<p>The oldest Christian settlement in the city, the barangay was named after the first Augustinian parish of Jesus dela Peña (Jesus of the Rocks). It derived its identity after a Christ-like image was seen on the rock formations in the area. Aside from being host to the city’s oldest church, the San Isidro Labrador, the place is also acknowledged as the traditional site of the first Holy Mass that was officiated in Marikina.</p>
				<p>In early colonial times, Jesus dela Peña was known as “Niyugan” (from niyog) because of the coconut plantations that dotted its agricultural landscape. With the arrival of the Jesuits, wheat from Mexico was introduced, earning another name for the place, the Tirriguhan, which is derivative of the Spanish “trigo” for wheat. Toward the latter part of colonial rule, influenced in part by the growing literacy among residents, alternative livelihoods, foremost of which was the shoe-making business, started to make a mark. The American Occupation greatly helped in developing the barangay. Health and educational infrastructure was introduced, while homespun industries became popular. In the years leading to the establishment of the Commonwealth, progress became more obvious.</p>
				<p>Marikina Bridge, a vital economic link to cities like Quezon and Manila, was formally opened in 1934. Under the Japanese rule, Jesus dela Peña, like many other areas in Marikina, was hit hard by atrocities. The Kempetai police, in particular, killed everyone who was suspected of spying for the Americans. The place was in ruins as a result of the indiscriminate bombings by the Allied Forces and invaders. Although devastated, Barangay Jesus dela Peña picked up the pieces and reassumed its role as the town’s shoe capital.</p>
				<p>Today, it ranks as one of the city’s most progressive business addresses.</p>
