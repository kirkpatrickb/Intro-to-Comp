				<h1>History</h2>
				
				<p>Barangay Industrial Valley Complex was created under Batas Pambansa Bilang 203, approved by the unicameral legislature on March 25,1982. The law is an offshoot of Pambansang Batas Bilang 1755. Under the law, the barangay was separated from Calumpang to form an independent barangay known as Barangay Industrial Valley.</p>
				<p>The new sub-territory would be legally be defined as follows: “Beginning from the intersection of Marikina Diversion Road and A. Bonifacio Avenue thence southward along the centerline of Marikina Diversion Road, until it intersects the centerline of Marikina River; thence southwest along the common boundary line of the municipality of Marikina and municipality of Pasig, province of Rizal, until it intersects the common boundary line of the municipality of Pasig and Quezon City; thence northward bounded by Quezon City until it intersects the point of beginning.”</p>
				<p>The first set of barangay officials was appointed by the President until their successors had been elected.</p>
