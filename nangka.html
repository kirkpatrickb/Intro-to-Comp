				<h1>History</h2>
				
				<p>Situated at the northernmost sector of Marikina along the concrete highway that leads to the towns of San Mateo and Montalban (Rizal), Barangay Nangka was the most rural among the city’s barangays. It started as a small settlement built by two pioneering families and later evolved into a flourishing community largely due to a river, which is the barangay’s namesake, that bilaterally cuts through Marikina and San Mateo, in Rizal Province.</p>
				<p>Named after the jack-fruit, Barangay Nangka was created under RA 260, which was approved by Congress on June 21, 1959.</p>
				<p>It is situated on an elevated section of the southeastern part of Marikina and traverses the road that leads from the city to the towns of San Mateo and Montalban (now Rodiguez) in Rizal Province, where it shares common boundaries with Nangka River. It stretches up to sitio Balubad and the old railroad tracks known as Daang Bakal, and has an area of 181.68 hectares.</p>
				<p>During colonial times, the area was home to rice fields and sugarcane plantations. Nangka was a thriving agricultural hub before it yielded to urban incursion; it was a primary source for root crops, vegetables, and rice. Conversion of farms into housing patches and the rise of commercial establishments eventually transformed the place into a population center and economic hub.</p>
