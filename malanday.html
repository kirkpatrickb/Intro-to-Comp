				<h1>History</h2>
				
				<p>Malanday was named after the shape of its territory, round and flat, just like that of a bilao (winnower). Malanday is bounded on the northeast by Barangay Concepcion, while to its southeast sector is Barangay Sto. Niño. On the southwest is Barangay Jesus dela Peña, and on the northwest is Quezon City.</p>
				<p>Mainly an agricultural area, Malanday was originally an uncultivated grassland that formed part of a rural community that would be known later for its rice field. To reach the place, pioneers had to transport and deliver commodities using the carabao-drawn cariton, given its ease in negotiating mud tracks.</p>
				<p>For Malanday residents, 1937 holds a special significance – it was the year they were released from the bondage of paying land taxes to the Tuasons, owner of most of the lands in Marikina. As a result, petitions for transfer of land ownership were filed.</p>
				<p>In response, the government bought a big chunk of a vast estate and distributed it to occupants, requiring only the beneficiaries to pay a nominal amount for every square meter of land owned over a period of one decade.</p>
				<p>This development would give rise to the founding of Barangay Malanday.</p>
