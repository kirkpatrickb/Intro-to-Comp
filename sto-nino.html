				<h1>History</h1>
				
				<p>
				Sabine Callas hails from the United States, with possible links to Seattle. Holding a doctorate and awards such as the R. Francis Prize and the Denton Outstanding Innovation Award, her previous occupations include roles with Kingdom Corporation, eventually becoming its first Chief Scientific Officer on the board of advisors, and influence over the conglomerate's ventures in Rabat, Morocco. At some point during her time there however, there was an "incident". Little is known about what happened, but everything changed for Callas at that point after all she lost because of it, leading her to isolate and dedicate herself to pursuing vengeance instead.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				After the events of First Light, the secretive VALORANT Protocol was founded, with Callas being one of its founders and becoming its second agent, "Viper", and second-in-command to Brimstone. One of its most active members as well as most experienced, Viper is involved with the recruitment of new agents and is active in many of their missions.
