				<h1>History</h2>
				
				<p>Oral tradition traces the barangay's origin to 1667 when the Jesuits crossed Marikina River from Jesus dela Peña in search of a place where a new church could be built and a mission established.</p>
				<p>The missionaries found a rustic area known as Halang, so named after the orientation of the place, which is perpendicular to the rising sun. The place was later dedicated to the Holy Child or Sto. Niño, after whom it was named. In colonial times, Barangay Sto. Niño was bounded on the north by Malanday, on the east by Apongao, Cupang, and Mayamot, on the south by Sta. Elena, and the west by the Marikina River. Originally, the river had its bank along J.P. Rizal Street but geologic movement, flash floods, and siltation eventually led to the formation of a fertile area known as Tumana.</p>
				<p>In 1903, Sto. Niño hosted the firsst Aglipayan Chapel that was built in a location adjacent to Marikina Bridge. Unfortunately, the structure was destroyed in World War II. A new house of worship was later built in another location but a big fire gutted it in 1908.</p>
