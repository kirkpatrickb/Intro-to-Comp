				<h1>History</h2>
				
				<p>During the war, Barangay Marikina Heights was a vital military defense location. The Japanese built tunnels in the area to stage ambuscades, hide ammunition, store provisions, or seek shelter. The underground subway notably made it easy for the Japanese to reach their airfields known among residents as the Paliparan (airport). In post-war times, it was also the military training ground for Filipino soldiers who were deployed to the Korean War.</p>
				<p>The initial effort to create the area into a barangay was made on June 6, 1974 through the advice of the municipal council, by virtue of Resolution No. 76, which was later submitted to the provincial board of Rizal for action. In response, Provincial Resolution No. 75-746 was passed, recommending the creation of Marikina Heights to President Marcos.</p>
				<p>On April 2, 1978, Presidential Decree 1489 was issued, formally creating the new barangay.</p>
