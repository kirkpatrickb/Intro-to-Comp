			<p>Hey there! My name is <strong>Raquel Garcia</strong> and I am a weapons artist on the VALORANT Premium Content team here at Riot.</p>
			
			<p>I was given the opportunity to work on the Piedra del Sol skinline and I’m excited to talk about my process during this artistic journey.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Sammi Pedregon</strong>, Art Outsource Supervisor on VALORANT, will also join me!</p>

				</div>
				
				<p>One thing that I enjoyed about working on this skinline was being able to dip my toes into some history and learn a lot more about the Aztec culture.</p>
				
				<p>I was assigned to create the Ghost weapon <strong>influenced by the Aztec god Xolotl.</strong></p>
				
				<p>He was commonly depicted as a human skeleton with the head of a canine who guided the dead through the Aztec underworld known as Mictlan.</p>
				
				<p>I wanted to grasp an artistic feel for this gun that would represent him well and would also fit into today's modern gaming world.</p>

				<p>(Concept Direction by Sean Bigham & Color by Sam Brown) After reviewing the initial concept, I felt that the face had more of a feline direction.</p>
				
				<p>I wanted this to appear more dog-like as the deity is described.</p>
		
				<p>After rounding the cheeks, squaring off the nose and introducing rounder ears, <strong>I was able to bring this design into a mutual representation of the original concept and Xolotl canine attributes</strong> with the intent of allowing players to question what type of animal this could be.</p>

				<p>The student athletes will compete in 34 sporting categories including new demo sports such as pencak silat, dancesport and aero gymnastics.</p>
				
				<p>The opening ceremony also became a venue for Marikina City to highlight its latest environmental campaign.</p>
				
				<p>The City Government’s recently launched “Munting Basura, Ibulsa Muna” campaign, which promotes the proper way of disposing trash in Marikina, became the highlight of this year’s opening ceremony of the NCR Palaro. The delegates together with local government and school officials joined in dancing to the jingle of the Munting Basura, Ibulsa Muna campaign.</p>

				<p>Even on such a short notice, Department of Education NCR Regional Director Wilfredo Cabral said that the opening ceremony hosted by Marikina was a success. Marikina was asked only a few weeks ago to host this year’s NCR Palaro.</p>
				
				<p>"It was very successful on the onset, kasi una pa lang inalok natin ito sa Lungsod ng Marikina hindi tayo tinanggihan kahit na sa maiksing panahon ng paghahanda," said Cabral in an interview by the state-run Radyo Pilipinas 2.</p>
				
				<p>Cabral is confident that the gold medalists in the NCR Palaro will help the region extend its championship reign to 14 years at this year’s Palarong Pambansa.</p>
				
				<p>Hosting the NCR Palaro 2019 is expected to boost Marikina City’s bid to host next year’s Palarong Pambansa after Davao City, which became its sister city in June 2018.</p>
				
				<p>The last time Marikina hosted the NCR Palaro was in 2017, the first under Mayor Marcy’s term as mayor of the city.</p>
